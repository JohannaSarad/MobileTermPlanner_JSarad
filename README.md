Note: This application was designed and tested to run on Android mobile devices. If you are not familiar with creating and running emulators in Visual Studio, I recommend that you run this application on a physical Android device. The correct emulator settings needed to run the application will vary depending on the system being used. You can reach any of the necessary settings to run the device on an emulator by selecting the “Tools” option  from the top toolbar, followed by the “Android” menu option you want to set.

* Tap the “Build Number” seven times to enable developer mode
* “Developer options” will now be visible inside of “Settings” . Click “Developer options”
* Enable the “USB Debugging” toggle and click “Ok”
* Open the application in Visual Studio and connect your Android phone to your system or laptop via USB cable.
* You may again be prompted to Allow USB Debugging. Click “Ok” 
* Click the down arrow to the right of the play button at the top of the Visual Studio Window to open a dropdowm
* Select your device from the menu and press play
* If your device does not immediately appear in the dropdown list, try unplugging the USB cable and plugging it back in or repeating the above steps
